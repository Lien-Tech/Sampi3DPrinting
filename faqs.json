        {
          "question": "What is 3D printing?",
          "answer": "3D printing, also referred to as additive manufacturing, is an innovative process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. Unlike traditional manufacturing methods that involve cutting or drilling, 3D printing builds objects layer by layer using various materials."
        },
        {
          "question": "How Does 3D Printing Work?",
          "answer": "3D printing works by taking a digital file, such as a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) model, and slicing it into thin horizontal layers. The 3D printer then reads these layers and deposits material, one layer at a time, until the entire object is built. This method allows for precise and intricate designs."
        },
        {
          "question": "What Materials Can Be Used For 3D Printing?",
          "answer": "There are many materials available for 3D printing, including thermoplastics (like PLA, ABS, and PETG), resins, metals (such as titanium and aluminum), ceramics, and even food-grade materials like chocolate or dough. The choice of material depends on the specific application and desired properties of the printed object."
